# Integrated Collision Research

This is a class project for info 201 in University of Washington.

- Link -> [(Seattle Collision Research) Simple Class interactive visualization project made by R Shiny app](https://bobbydyr.shinyapps.io/project-AC2-traffic/)

## Why Are We Interested
We are interested in this field/domain to better understand the effects of certain variables such as the color of cars, weather, and age of driver on things like fatality of accidents. More specifically we plan to answer the question: Do red cars really get pulled over for traffic violations more often than other color cars?


## Existing Projects in the Domain
**Project #1  
_SEA Traffic Accident Prediction_**  

This project is a student project that use publicly available and relevant data to identify predictive features and models of car accidents in Seattle, create an automatable data pipeline and build a live app reporting likelihoods.

## Questions We Hope to Answer

#### 1. Of the accidents how, what proportion is fatal?

We can calculate percatage of the ones that are fatal and then compare to the total number. We can even calculate what car model or weather condition affect the fatal rate.

#### 2. What variable most affects fatality of a crash?

We can calculate each possiblity of each cause and then find the max value.

#### 3. What age range gets pulled over the most for speeding?

We can make a graph and see what age area has the greatest pullover rate.

## Our Data Source

#### Data
- Data is collected from Seattle GSI. Includes collisions in Seattle from 2004 - present. The data consists of factors involving specific collisions such as weather if bicycles were present, fatalities, and location.

- There are 208,444 observations and 40 features in the dataset.

- This dataset can be used to answer questions referring to the location of the accidents and proportion of fatalities.
